# PHP Media Library
A PHP application which displays various media types on a site. Users can view a random selection of media on the home page, as well as limiting data from the full catalog into category pages. This was a fun tutorial to revisit pure PHP, rather than coding with Frameworks such as Laravel or CodeIgniter. The application is very simplistic at the moment but could be updated in multiple ways.
